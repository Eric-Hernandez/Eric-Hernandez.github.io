    <h1>Hey, I'm Eric</h1>

    <img src=img/me.jpg />

    <p>I currently live in Miami and recently graduated from the University of Miami.  During my time at the university, I majored in Psychology and minored in Computer Science and Business Administration. Though I just graduated, I pride myself in my work ethic. The work I produced is polymerization of professionalism and creativity. I use all of the tools I am given to produce meaningful results.</p>

    <p>I currently work for LVB Bookkeeping as a bookkeeper.  There, I manage the balance sheets, general ledgers, and other accounting documents for clients.  This job has been a gateway into the wonderful world of data. </p>

    <p>While at the university, I worked as a research assistant in the Department of Psychology.  Though my job was to act as a confederate in participant sessions, I found myself staying behind late helping the team enter and analyze participant data through statistical methods in order to reach a conclusion about our research questions.  Ever since then, I have discovered my passion for data and statistical analysis. </p>
